Notes from J. Stark

Array: var foods = ['Apples', 'Bananas', 'Oranges'];
basically just like c++
the '+' concatenates

interact with
the elements of an HTML page 
(the cool kids call this “manipulating the DOM”)

you can call a function using onclick="sayHello()" pg 10

need to have downloaded the jquery library and save teh jquery.js 
file with your web pages. 

jQuery downloads, documentation, and tutorials are available at http:
//jquery.com. To use jQuery as shown in Example 1-9, you will need to
download it from there, rename the file you downloaded (such as
jquery-1.4.2.min.js) to jquery.js, and put a copy of it in the same directory as your HTML document.

you can use WURFL’s PHP API to precisely detect specific
browsers. See the Appendix for more information on WURFL.


If you don’t set the viewport width, the page will be zoomed out when
it first loads. It’s tough to say exactly what the zoom level will be because
the Android browser includes a setting that allows users to set the default zoom. The options are Far, Medium (the default), or Close. Even
if you do set the viewport width, these user-defined settings will affect
the zoom level of your app.

All text on Android is rendered using a custom font named Droid. The
Droid font family was specifically built for mobile devices, has excellent
character set support, and contains three variants: Droid Sans, Droid
Sans Mono, and Droid Serif. Therefore, specifying a font family of Helvetica as we’ve done here will only have an effect on devices other than
Android.
